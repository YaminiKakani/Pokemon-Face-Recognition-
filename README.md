## üßæ Project Overview

This project explores the adaptability of pre-trained CNNs to stylized, domain-specific datasets like Pok√©mon faces. It evaluates the performance of three architectures:

- **MobileNetV2**
- **EfficientNetB0**
- **ResNet50**

Each model was fine-tuned on a curated Pok√©mon dataset and evaluated using:
- ‚úÖ Accuracy
- üìä F1-Score
- üìâ AUC-ROC
- ‚è± Inference Time

---

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs on a custom Pok√©mon dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied rotation, shifting, shearing, and flipping to enhance generalization.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluated accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and inference time across three models.
- **Web Interface**: Deployed the best model (ResNet50) via a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
